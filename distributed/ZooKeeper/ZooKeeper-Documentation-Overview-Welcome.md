# ZooKeeper

`ZooKeeper is a distributed, open-source coordination service for distributed applications.`

Coordination services are notoriously hard to get right. They are especially prone to errors such as race conditions and deadlock. `The motivation behind ZooKeeper is to relieve distributed applications the responsibility of implementing coordination services from scratch.`

# Design Goals

## ZooKeeper is simple

Unlike a typical file system, which is designed for storage, `ZooKeeper data is kept in-memory, which means ZooKeeper can acheive high throughput and low latency numbers.`

## ZooKeeper is replicated

## ZooKeeper is ordered

## ZooKeeper is fast

# Data model and the hierarchical namespace

# Nodes and ephemeral nodes

# Conditional updates and watches

# Guarantees

# Simple API

# Implementation

# Uses

# Performance

# Reliability

# The ZooKeeper Project
